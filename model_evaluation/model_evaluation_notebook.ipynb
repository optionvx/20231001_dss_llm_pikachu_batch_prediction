    "\n",
    "Negative Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus on Sentiment Words:** Look for words that express a negative opinion or dissatisfaction, such as \"overrated,\" \"not worth it,\" \"wish was different,\" \"annoying,\" or \"too predictable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Comparisons:** Pay attention to comparisons that place the subject in a negative light compared to something else. For example, \"Pikachu's popularity has overshadowed other great PokÃ©mon\" implies that Pikachu doesn't deserve its popularity compared to other PokÃ©mon.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Look for Wishes or Desires for Change:** If the post expresses a wish or desire for something to be different, it may indicate dissatisfaction with the current state. For example, \"I wish Ash had a different starter PokÃ©mon\" shows a desire for change and potential negativity towards the current situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consider Hashtags:** Hashtags can often provide context about the post's sentiment. For example, #Boycott is a clear indication of a negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pay Attention to Emoji Usage:** Emojis can often convey the tone of the post. A frustrated or angry emoji can indicate a negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Take into Account the Overall Tone:** Look at the post as a whole and consider the overall tone. If the post seems to be expressing dissatisfaction, disappointment, or frustration, it is likely negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Note any Call to Action:** If the post includes a call to action that is based on a negative sentiment, such as boycotting, it is likely negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Look for Positive Words or Phrases:** Focus on words or phrases that express a positive opinion, satisfaction, or praise, such as \"love,\" \"pleasure,\" \"cute,\" \"well-made,\" \"charming,\" \"can't get enough of,\" or \"exciting things are coming.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Positive Experiences or Memories:** Pay attention to positive experiences or fond memories mentioned in the post. For example, \"I've had a Pikachu plushie since I was a kid\" or \"I've been a fan of Pikachu since I was a kid\" show a positive emotional connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consider Hashtags:** Hashtags can often provide context about the post's sentiment. For example, #Pikachu combined with positive words or phrases is a clear indication of a positive sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pay Attention to Emoji Usage:** Emojis can often convey the tone of the post. Positive emojis such as hearts or smiley faces can indicate a positive sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Take into Account the Overall Tone:** Look at the post as a whole and consider the overall tone. If the post seems to be expressing happiness, satisfaction, or excitement, it is likely positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Notice Expressions of Pride or Accomplishment:** If the post expresses pride or accomplishment, such as winning a battle or having a productive meeting, it is likely positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Check for Expressions of Affection or Nostalgia:** Posts that express affection for or nostalgia about the subject, such as mentioning a cherished childhood toy or a special place in one's heart, are likely positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus on Factual Statements:** Look for statements that are factual or informative, without expressing a clear positive or negative opinion. For example, \"Pikachu's height is 0.4 meters\" or \"Pikachu can use the move Quick Attack.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Lack of Emotional Language:** Neutral posts often lack emotional language or sentiments, such as \"love,\" \"hate,\" \"exciting,\" or \"disappointing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consider Hashtags:** Hashtags can provide context about the post's content, but in neutral posts, they often relate to the topic without adding sentiment. For example, #Pikachu combined with a factual statement is likely neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pay Attention to Emoji Usage:** Emojis can often convey the tone of the post. Neutral posts may use emojis that are related to the content without expressing a strong positive or negative emotion, such as a lightning bolt emoji for Pikachu's tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Look for Descriptions or Explanations:** Neutral posts may include descriptions or explanations that add context to the topic without expressing a clear sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Check for Research or Study References:** Posts that reference research, reports, case studies, or other forms of investigation are likely to be neutral, as they often focus on factual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Consider Conversational Posts:** Conversations that simply share information or preferences, without expressing a strong sentiment, are likely neutral. For example, \"Had a conversation with a friend about our favorite PokÃ©mon.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Negative Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus on Sentiment Words:** Look for words that express a negative opinion or dissatisfaction, such as \"overrated,\" \"not worth it,\" \"wish was different,\" \"annoying,\" or \"too predictable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Comparisons:** Pay attention to comparisons that place the subject in a negative light compared to something else. For example, \"Pikachu's popularity has overshadowed other great PokÃ©mon\" implies that Pikachu doesn't deserve its popularity compared to other PokÃ©mon.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Look for Wishes or Desires for Change:** If the post expresses a wish or desire for something to be different, it may indicate dissatisfaction with the current state. For example, \"I wish Ash had a different starter PokÃ©mon\" shows a desire for change and potential negativity towards the current situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consider Hashtags:** Hashtags can often provide context about the post's sentiment. For example, #Boycott is a clear indication of a negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pay Attention to Emoji Usage:** Emojis can often convey the tone of the post. A frustrated or angry emoji can indicate a negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Take into Account the Overall Tone:** Look at the post as a whole and consider the overall tone. If the post seems to be expressing dissatisfaction, disappointment, or frustration, it is likely negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Note any Call to Action:** If the post includes a call to action that is based on a negative sentiment, such as boycotting, it is likely negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Look for Positive Words or Phrases:** Focus on words or phrases that express a positive opinion, satisfaction, or praise, such as \"love,\" \"pleasure,\" \"cute,\" \"well-made,\" \"charming,\" \"can't get enough of,\" or \"exciting things are coming.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Positive Experiences or Memories:** Pay attention to positive experiences or fond memories mentioned in the post. For example, \"I've had a Pikachu plushie since I was a kid\" or \"I've been a fan of Pikachu since I was a kid\" show a positive emotional connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consider Hashtags:** Hashtags can often provide context about the post's sentiment. For example, #Pikachu combined with positive words or phrases is a clear indication of a positive sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pay Attention to Emoji Usage:** Emojis can often convey the tone of the post. Positive emojis such as hearts or smiley faces can indicate a positive sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Take into Account the Overall Tone:** Look at the post as a whole and consider the overall tone. If the post seems to be expressing happiness, satisfaction, or excitement, it is likely positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Notice Expressions of Pride or Accomplishment:** If the post expresses pride or accomplishment, such as winning a battle or having a productive meeting, it is likely positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Check for Expressions of Affection or Nostalgia:** Posts that express affection for or nostalgia about the subject, such as mentioning a cherished childhood toy or a special place in one's heart, are likely positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus on Factual Statements:** Look for statements that are factual or informative, without expressing a clear positive or negative opinion. For example, \"Pikachu's height is 0.4 meters\" or \"Pikachu can use the move Quick Attack.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check for Lack of Emotional Language:** Neutral posts often lack emotional language or sentiments, such as \"love,\" \"hate,\" \"exciting,\" or \"disappointing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consider Hashtags:** Hashtags can provide context about the post's content, but in neutral posts, they often relate to the topic without adding sentiment. For example, #Pikachu combined with a factual statement is likely neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pay Attention to Emoji Usage:** Emojis can often convey the tone of the post. Neutral posts may use emojis that are related to the content without expressing a strong positive or negative emotion, such as a lightning bolt emoji for Pikachu's tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Look for Descriptions or Explanations:** Neutral posts may include descriptions or explanations that add context to the topic without expressing a clear sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Check for Research or Study References:** Posts that reference research, reports, case studies, or other forms of investigation are likely to be neutral, as they often focus on factual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Consider Conversational Posts:** Conversations that simply share information or preferences, without expressing a strong sentiment, are likely neutral. For example, \"Had a conversation with a friend about our favorite PokÃ©mon.\"\n",
